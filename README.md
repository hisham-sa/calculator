# Calculator ðŸ§®
**Calculator** is a simple calculator program that performs various mathematical operations. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, exponentiation, factorial, odd/even checks, absolute values, and average calculations.

## Key Features
- **Basic mathematical operations** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and  division.
- **Percentage**
- **Exponentiation**
- **Odd/Even Checks**
- **Absolute Value**
- **Average Calculation**

## Class Details

1. **App** class is the entry point of the calculator program. It interacts with the user via the `Scanner s1`  and performs the following:
- Displays a menu of operations.
- handles user inputs and manages invalid entries.
- Calls appropriate methods in the `operations` class for calculations.
